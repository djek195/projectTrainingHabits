# projectTrainingHabits
This is a web application designed to help users develop habits. I used JavaScript to implement it without any frameworks or libraries.

The application allows users to set their goals and specify the number of days they will train for. Every day, the user has the ability 
to mark whether they have achieved their goal and leave comments about their progress. The progress bar is updated every day, helping
the user to evaluate their success in achieving their goal.
